Social Engineering 
-------------

### Phishing

Phishing is the most common type of **social engineering attack** where attackers masquerade as a trusted entity to dupe a victim into opening an email, message, or link, which can lead to the theft of sensitive data.

These attacks can come in various forms, and they are distinguished  based on their **methods, targets, and the platforms they use**. Here are  some common types of phishing attacks:

* **Email Phishing** : The most common type. Attackers **send emails** that appear to be from reputable sources to trick individuals into **revealing personal information**

* **Spear phishing** : More targeted than email phishing. Attackers customize their messages with the victim's name, position, company, or other personal details to make the scam more believable.
  * Whaling : Spear phishing targeting high-profile individulas like CEOs or CFOs. 


* **Vishing** (Voice Phishing) :

* **Smishing** (SMS Phishing) :

* **Pharming**: **Redirects users from legitimate websites to fraudulent ones.** This is  often achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the DNS system.

* **Clone Phishing** : Involves creating an almost identical **replica of a legitimate message**  that a user has already received, but with malicious links or  attachments.

* **Angler Phishing** : **Occurs on social media platforms**. Attackers impersonate customer service accounts to reach out to individuals who have posted about issues with a product or service.

* **Pop-up Phishing** : Involves pop-up windows that appear on websites, often looking like legitimate requests for information or offers of assistance.

* **Search Engine Phishing** : Attackers create fraudulent websites and use search engine optimization tactics to appear in search results for certain keywords.

The criteria for distinguishing these types are based on:

1. **Communication Medium**: Whether the attack is via email, phone, text, social media, etc.
2. **Target Specificity**: Whether the attack is broad (general phishing) or targeted at specific individuals or groups (spear phishing, whaling).
3. **Method of Attack**: The technique used, such as exploiting DNS systems (pharming), using cloned messages (clone phishing), or leveraging social media platforms (angler phishing).

### Pretexting

The attacker invents a scenario to engage a target and extract  information or gain access, often involving impersonation of authority  figures or professionals.

### Impersonation 

Assuming the identity of someone else (like a technician, coworker, or authority figure) to gain trust and access.

### Baiting

Luring victims by offering something enticing (could be physical like a  USB drive or digital like a download link) to steal information or  install malware.

### Quid Pro Quo

Offering a service or benefit in exchange for information. It often involves promises of assistance or rewards.

### Tailgating/Piggybacking

Gaining unauthorized physical access by following someone authorized into a restricted area or system.

### Diversion Theft

Physically redirecting or misdirecting goods or information to steal or gather information.

### Honey Trap

Using romantic or personal relationships as a means to obtain confidential information.

### Watering Hole Attack

Compromising a trusted website to target its users.

### Criteria to Distinguish Different Types

1. **Medium of Attack**: Whether the attack is digital (like phishing, pretexting) or physical (like tailgating, diversion theft).
2. **Target Specificity**: Attacks can be broad (general phishing) or highly targeted (spear phishing, whaling).
3. **Method of Engagement**: Some attacks involve direct interaction (vishing, impersonation), while others are indirect (phishing emails, baiting).
4. **Type of Lure**: The incentive or pretext used, such as offering help (quid pro quo), exploiting curiosity (baiting), or creating a false narrative (pretexting).
5. **Level of Personal Interaction**: Whether the attack requires face-to-face interaction (tailgating), remote communication (phishing), or no direct interaction (watering hole).
6. **Objective**: Gaining information (phishing, pretexting), access (tailgating, impersonation), or disrupting operations (diversion theft).
