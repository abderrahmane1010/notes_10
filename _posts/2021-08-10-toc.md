Social Engineering 
-------------

### Phishing :

Phishing is the most common type of **social engineering attack** where attackers masquerade as a trusted entity to dupe a victim into opening an email, message, or link, which can lead to the theft of sensitive data.

These attacks can come in various forms, and they are distinguished  based on their **methods, targets, and the platforms they use**. Here are  some common types of phishing attacks:

* **Email Phishing** : The most common type. Attackers **send emails** that appear to be from reputable sources to trick individuals into **revealing personal information**

* **Spear phishing** : More targeted than email phishing. Attackers customize their messages with the victim's name, position, company, or other personal details to make the scam more believable.
  * Whaling : Spear phishing targeting high-profile individulas like CEOs or CFOs. 


* **Vishing** (Voice Phishing) :

* **Smishing** (SMS Phishing) :

* **Pharming**: **Redirects users from legitimate websites to fraudulent ones.** This is  often achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the DNS system.

* **Clone Phishing** : Involves creating an almost identical **replica of a legitimate message**  that a user has already received, but with malicious links or  attachments.

* **Angler Phishing** : **Occurs on social media platforms**. Attackers impersonate customer service accounts to reach out to individuals who have posted about issues with a product or service.

* **Pop-up Phishing** : Involves pop-up windows that appear on websites, often looking like legitimate requests for information or offers of assistance.

* **Search Engine Phishing** : Attackers create fraudulent websites and use search engine optimization tactics to appear in search results for certain keywords.

The criteria for distinguishing these types are based on:

1. **Communication Medium**: Whether the attack is via email, phone, text, social media, etc.
2. **Target Specificity**: Whether the attack is broad (general phishing) or targeted at specific individuals or groups (spear phishing, whaling).
3. **Method of Attack**: The technique used, such as exploiting DNS systems (pharming), using cloned messages (clone phishing), or leveraging social media platforms (angler phishing).
